# Waste-Collection-Route-Optimization

This B.Sc. thesis project applies Operations Research models to optimize municipal waste collection routes, achieving a 6% reduction in distance and fuel consumption.

## 1. The Business Problem

The municipality of Cuajimalpa faced inefficient, high-cost waste collection routes. The goal was to use mathematical optimization to design new routes that would significantly reduce the total distance traveled by the collection fleet.

## 2. Data & Tech Stack

* **Data:** The street network was mapped using **GPX Studio** and processed with **Python (Pandas)** to extract segment distance, directionality, and connectivity.
* **Tech Stack:** **Python (Pandas, PuLP)**, **Lingo**.

## 3. Model Architecture

I developed a comparative analysis of three LP models and one heuristic to find the most effective routing strategy.

* **Model 1 & 2 (RCPP & k-CPP):** These foundational models solved the Rural Chinese Postman Problem (RCPP) to find the shortest total route and the k-Chinese Postman Problem (k-CPP) to partition routes among *k* trucks, minimizing total fleet distance.

* **Model 3: The Min-Max Model (Balanced Workloads):**
    * **Objective:** The primary model, designed to **minimize the length of the *longest* route**. This ensures balanced workloads among crews, preventing one truck from finishing hours after others.
    * **Challenge:** Due to the enormous solution space and high computation time, this model could not find a provably optimal solution in a reasonable timeframe. This challenge directly motivated the development of a practical heuristic.

* **Heuristic Solution: Cycle Trade Tabu Search:**
    * **Objective:** To find a high-quality, near-optimal solution for the Min-Max problem in a fraction of the time.
    * **Value:** This demonstrates a practical, high-speed alternative essential for real-world deployment on large-scale networks where optimality is computationally infeasible.

## 4. Results & Impact

The optimized routes, generated by the heuristic and Min-Max model, achieved a **6% reduction in total distance traveled** compared to existing routes.

This 6% reduction directly translates to:
* Lower daily fuel costs.
* Reduced vehicle maintenance and CO2 emissions.
* More balanced and
